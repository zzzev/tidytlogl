# tidytlogl

An R package that computes log-likelihood values for tokens or ngrams of text.
This package is a re-implementation of @walkerkq's
[tmLogL package](https://github.com/walkerkq/tmLogL) using dplyr, which fits
into a tidy text mining workflow.

See https://github.com/walkerkq/textmining_southpark for more context, and
a good explanation of how this works.
